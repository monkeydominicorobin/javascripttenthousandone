# The Ten Thousand Lines of Code Routine

###My JavaScript Journey

###Hackers are simple people. They communicate through codes. I started the habit of programming nerdy and seemingly useless sets of JAVASCRIPT codes in a slope up progression but unexpectedly in a span of just a few short days I was able to create a thousand lines. You will say that my efforts are childish but wait until you do this without shortcuts.This demontrates inefficient but real life struggle with codes. In real life it pays to actively participate in hacking. It is stupid for coders to think that a semester's worth of Javascript is enough to get a deeper understanding of what this language is really all about. Programming is all about exploration which is pretty much like singing. Your ability will be judged based on your mastery of detail and you cannot reach a certain level of mastery with just a few lines of code everyday. As a matter of fact I noticed that 2000 lines of simple functions can take up atleast 60,000 bytes or 60 Kilobytes of virtual storage space.It is mind blowing but the discipline and perseveverance that you get out of all this is more than enough to keep you going until you reach the 10,000 line mark.
